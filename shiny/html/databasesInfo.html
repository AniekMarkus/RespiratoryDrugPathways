<h3>Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI), Netherlands, Erasmus University</h3>

<p>
IPCI is collected from EHR records of patients registered with their GPs throughout the Netherlands. The selection of 391 GPs is representative of the entire country. The database contains records from 1.4 million patients out of a Dutch population of 17M (8.2%) starting in 1996. The median follow-up is 2.2 years. The observation period for a patient is determined by the date of registration at the GP and the date of leave/death. The observation period start date is refined by many quality indicators, e.g. exclusion of peaks of conditions when registering at the GP. All data before the observation period is kept as history data. Drugs are captured as prescription records with product, quantity, dosing directions, strength and indication. The duration of the drug exposure is determined for all drugs in the database by: 1. The amount and dose extracted from the sig or if instruction is “see product instructions” we use the DDD and quantity; 2. Duration available in the record; 3. If option 1 and 2 is not possible we use the DDD derived duration, use the modal duration or default to 30 days dependent on the drug of interest. Drugs not prescribed in the GP setting might be underreported. Indications are available as diagnoses by the GPs and, indirectly, from secondary care providers but the latter might not be complete. Approval needs to be obtained for each study from the Governance Board. (Vlug, van der Lei et al. 1999)")"</p>
